# Introducing the use of functions
'''
Functions are defined using the "def" keyword
Functions are like variables except an entire block of code can be placed into a function

# A function contains a Block of code which only runs when it is called
# The round () brackets at the end of the string lets python know we are calling a function


# Function Parameters
# Information can be passed into functions as parameters
# Parameters are also called arguments (input)
